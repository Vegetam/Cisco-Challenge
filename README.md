Frontend developer coding challenge.

Create a React application that displays a page with a list of Doctor Who episodes.
Use Maze TV API to fetch all the episodes:
http://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=doctor%20who&embed=episodes

1. Page should display cards for all episodes grouped by season
2. Each card should display an episode name, number and season
3. Each card should link to a detailed episode page which contains episode summary 
4. User should be able to search for episodes with a keyword match in their summary

You can use Create React App or any boilerplate repository available to start the app, but be prepared to explain your decision. Feel free to use any approach for fetching, storing and querying data.

Extra points for:
- unit tests
- development/production webpack configuration


Here is the app :
![website image][]
![website image 2][]
![website image 3][]


[website image]: /src/assets/image1.png "Screenshot 1"
[website image 2]: /src/assets/image4.png "Screenshot 2"
[website image 3]: /src/assets/image3.png "Screenshot 3"
